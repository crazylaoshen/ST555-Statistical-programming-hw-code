# Question 1
```{r}
# part 1
int <- c(1:50)# Create a vector ¡°ints¡± that contains the integers from 1 to 50.
int
# part 2
powertwo <- 2^int 
#Create a vector ¡°powertwo¡± that raises the integers 1 to 50 to the power of 2
powertwo
```


# Question 2
```{r}

squared50 <- int^2
# Create a vector called ¡°squared50¡± that captures n2 for the first 50 integers
squared50

```

# Question 3
```{r}
equal <- powertwo == squared50 
#Create a vector ¡°equal¡± that holds the logical operators integers
equal
numEqual <- sum(equal == 1) # There are 2 pairs
numEqual
powertwo[equal] # print out the pairs  which satisfy equality

```
